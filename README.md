# Calculator
This is a pretty simple calculator, with several convertors and calculators inside.
To run it on your computer (main branch), you need to start server.js, and for it you need node.js and npm.
To get `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, run <br>
`> npm install`,
And to start the server, run <br>
`> npm run dev`
