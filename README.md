# Calculator
This is a pretty simple calculator, with several convertors and calculators inside.
To run it on your computer (main branch), you need to start server.js, and for it you need node.js and npm.
To get `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, run <br>
`> npm install`,
And to start the server, run <br>
`> npm run dev`

In this branch however, you don't need node.js at all. Just run any html file from /public and it should work.
However currency-exchange is not currently supported as it would be hard to implement for github pages to work properly.
